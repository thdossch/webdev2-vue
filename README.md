This is an assignment for the course web development at the university of Ghent ( 2nd bachelor computer science )

We had to make a frontend application for the exemple solution of our previous project (https://github.com/thdossch/webdev1-express).

To run clone the repository and use: npm install , after installation of the node-modules use: npm start
