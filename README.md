# Vue application for auction-api
This is an assignment for the course web development taught by professor Ruben Verborgh at Ghent University

We had to make a frontend application for the exemple solution of our previous project (https://github.com/thdossch/webdev1-express).

To run clone the repository and use: `npm install` , after installation of the node-modules use: `npm run serve`

This project is made together with Freya van Speybroeck. (https://github.com/freyavs)
